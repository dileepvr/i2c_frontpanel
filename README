i2c Frontpanel with 7-segment digits, pushbuttons, and two LEDs
---------------------------------------------------------------

Dumb frontpanel for small projects. Can be daisy-chained as long as
you do not populate all (except one) of the i2c pull-up resistors.

Powered by ATTiny88.

4-pin inter-header spacing is arduino compatible.

The PCBnew files are:

* 1x7seg_4btn.kicad_pcb (One 7-segment digit, four buttons, two LEDs)
* 2x7seg_4btn.kicad_pcb (Two 7-segment digits, four buttons, two LEDs)
* 4x7seg_6btn.kicad_pcb (Four 7-segment digits, six buttons, two LEDs)
* 4btn.kicad_pcb (Four buttons, two LEDs)
* 6btn.kicad_pcb (Six buttons, two LEDs)
* i2c_frontpanel.kicad_pcb (Same as 4x7seg_6btn.kicad_pcb)

Gerber files included for 4x7seg_6btn.kicad_pcb and
1x7seg_4btn.kicad_pcb designs.
